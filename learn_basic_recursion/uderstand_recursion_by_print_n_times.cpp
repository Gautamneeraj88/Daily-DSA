/*
 * Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly
 * to solve a problem, by breaking it down into smaller subproblems until it
 * reaches a base case that stops further calls.
 */

/*
 * What is Stack Overflow in Recursion?
 *
 * Whenever recursion calls are executed, they're simultaneously stored in the
 * recursion stack whhere they wait for the completion of the recursive
 * function. A recursive function can only be compeleted if a base condition is
 * fulfilled and the control returns to the parent function.
 *
 * But, when there is no base condition given for a particular recursive
 * function, it gets called indefinitely which results in a stack overflow i.e.,
 * exceeding the memory limit of the recursion stack and hence the program
 * terminates giving a Segmentation Fault error.
 */

/*
 * Base Condition
 *
 * It is the condition that is written in a recursive function in order for it
 * to get completed and not to run infinitely. After encountering te base
 * condition, the function terminates and returns back to its parent function
 * simultaneously.
 */

/**
 * Recursive Tree
 *
 * A recursive tree is basically a representation of recursion which depicts how
 * funtions are called as a series  of events happening consecutively. it is a
 * pictorial description of the process of recursion.
 */

/**
 * Advantages of Recursion
 *
 * Simplifies code: Complex problems can be solved in fewer lines of code
 compared to iterative solutions.
 * Natural representation: Problems that are recursive in
 nature (like tree traversals, factorial, Fibonacci, etc.) are easier to
 express.
 * Reduces code complexity: Avoids writing nested loops, making the logic
 more readable and elegant.
 * Useful in divide-and-conquer algorithms: Essential
 for algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, Binary Search, and Dynamic
 Programming.
 */

/**
 * Disadvantages of Recursion

 * High memory usage: Each recursive call adds a new layer to the function call
 stack, which may lead to memory overhead.
 * Risk of stack overflow: Without
 proper base cases, infinite recursion can occur and crash the program.
 * Slower
 execution: Function calls and returns add extra overhead compared to simple
 loops.
 * Harder to debug: Tracing recursive calls can be confusing, especially in
 deep recursion.
